Goals
	To make a graphic engine that can load a shader


Challenges
	I found this project to be of a different kind of difficulty. I should have 

kept a visual of the pipeline at all times because I kept forgeting how things worked 

and the order I needed to do things. My frags and verts kept getting mixed up as well.

Triumphs
	While I still have more to learn, I found that I had figured out almost all of 

the skills we learned the year prior. This surprised me greatly, as I hadn't practiced 

over the summer. Also, I was able to keep up with the lessons at a better rate.

Failures
	I still have a problem with focus sometimes. Also, I still can't seem to get 

bloom and blur to work.
