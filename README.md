# GraphicEngine
This is a simple graphic engine using OpenGL designed to load files and diplay them with various shaders. This will be an ongoing project that I will attempt to improve upon as much as possible. Much thanks goes to my teacher Esme for it's progress and function. Also, thanks to Terry for helping me out when stuff broke, and Braiden for helping me with Bloom Mapping and Blur.
